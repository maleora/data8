				<p class="description">
					A new book in the nationally bestselling series that has wowed critics and readers alike. David Loogan returns! Loogan is living in Ann Arbor with Detective Elizabeth Waishkey and her daughter, Sarah. He&#39;s settled into a quiet routine as editor of the mystery magazine Gray Streets -- until one day he finds a manuscript outside his door. It begins: &#34;I killed Henry Kormoran.&#34; Anthony Lark has drawn up a list of names -- Terry Dawtrey, Sutton Bell, Henry Kormoran. To his eyes, the names glow red on the page. They move. They breathe. The three men on the list have little in...

				<p>Come on,&#34; I said. &#34;You think you&#39;re going to ask the wrong question and--what?--the Spencers are going to make you disappear?&#34;&#34;I can&#39;t rule it out,&#34; she said.&#34;Actually, I think you can.&#34;&#34;We&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll call you after, let you know how it goes. If you don&#39;t hear from me, well, you do what you think is right. If I disappear, maybe you can find me.&#34;Her voice had turned careless and light, but I thought I could still hear an undertone of gravity in it.&#34;If you can&#39;t find me,&#34; she said, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t mind being avenged.(p159) Harry Dolan, Very Bad Men // I almost let it go. I think it was the yellow dress. It made me want to give her the benefit of the doubt. What can you say about a woman who wears a yellow dress to break into an office at night? How bad can her intentions be?Still, I was reasonably certain she wasn&#39;t telling the truth. Not that it bothered me. Not really. I watched her sitting there, bent slightly forward, the palm of her right hand open in her lap, her left hand rubbing her shoulder. Lips curled in a smile. Innocent eyes looking back at me. It was like being lied to by a basket of... Ornate language tended to unsettle him. Passages from nineteenth-century novels might glow like hot coals or squirm like heaps of snakes. In fact, he tried not to read anything written before the First World War. Hemingway made a good cutoff point. Hemingway&#39;s sentences were a nice deep blue, and they mostly held still, like stalks of wheat on a windless day.(p18) Harry Dolan, Very Bad Men //</p>
				<p>3.0 out of 5 stars - &#34;We all want to be seen for who we really are...&#34;This is the second novel featuring David Loogan and his live-in partner Elizabeth Waishkey. David is the editor and publisher of mystery stories for a magazine called &#34;Gray Streets&#34;. Elizabeth is a detective for the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. In a very unlikely... The case that entangles Detective Waishkey and Buttinski Editor Loogan brings forward a 17 year old bank robbery in Sault Ste. Marie, and those who were involved, may have been, couldn&#39;t possibly be and everyone remotely connected between Brimley and Dearborn. We have a fistful of suspects who might be the getaway driver who got away... I received a copy of this book from a first-reads giveaway.Overall, I liked the book. Even though it seems as though the reader knows all the &#34;bad guys&#34; from the beginning, there are still a few plot twists that keep it interesting.</p>
